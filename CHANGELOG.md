## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-23

### Added

#### Smart Content Analysis System
- **Configurable Generic Patterns**: Revolutionary user-configurable system replacing 120+ hard-coded patterns
  - 192 generic patterns organized across 9 logical categories (update_feature, guide_tutorial, general_tech, cloud_aws, business_industry, time_frequency, quality_status, descriptors, actions)
  - Complete user control via YAML configuration - users can add custom domains, languages, and patterns
  - Enable/disable functionality via `generic_patterns_enabled` setting for flexible testing
  - Type-safe configuration with Pydantic validation and comprehensive defaults

#### Enhanced Semantic Analysis
- **Advanced Semantic Penalty Classification**: Smart keyword categorization for improved topic matching accuracy

  - Semantic penalties applied to articles with high generic keyword ratios
  - 56.4% score reduction for generic content vs specific content (0.732 → 0.319)
  - Context-aware routing decisions preventing false positives

### Fixed

#### Critical Production Issues
- **False Positive Resolution**: Resolved production issue where AWS Weekly Roundup incorrectly matched EKS/ECS topics
  - Root cause: Generic keywords ("new feature", "best practices", "new update") were treated as topic-specific
  - Solution: Enhanced semantic penalty system correctly identifies and penalizes generic content
  - Result: Articles with generic content now route to "definitely_irrelevant" instead of false positives

#### Core Algorithm Improvements
- **Pre-filter Partial Word Matching**: Fixed partial word matching logic to require ALL words in multi-word keywords
  - Previously: Partial matches (1 of 3 words) received partial credit leading to false positives
  - Now: Multi-word keywords require complete word coverage for scoring
  - Maintains backward compatibility while improving precision
